pyroboplan
==========

``pyroboplan`` is an educational Python library for manipulator motion planning.

This library extensively uses the `Pinocchio <https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio>`_ Python bindings for modeling robot kinematics and dynamics.

Note the **educational** in this library description.
It is not designed for performance, but rather to teach newcomers the fundamentals of motion planning in an easy-to-use environment with :examples:`many examples <>`.
